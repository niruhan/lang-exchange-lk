## CHAPTER ONE – INTRODUCTION (2330)


### 1.1 – Background of the Study

Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic, multi-linguistic country where three languages are widely spoken. They are Sinhala, Tamil, and English. Many people take language classes for several years without being able to have a simple communication with a native speaker of the language they are learning. Even at language schools, Sri Lankans don’t get enough chances to use their target language (target language is the language one is trying to learn). In addition, it is next to impossible to find a native speaker of your target language in your class. This further limits a students chances to practice their target language. This project aims to develop a language exchange platform as a web application where language learners in Sri Lanka can meet native speakers of their target language and learn together.

Culturally, Sri Lankans are rather afraid of making mistakes or embarrassing themselves in front of others. However, this is the primary requirement to acquire a second language. We need to make mistakes happily a lot of times before we can start speaking comfortably in a second language. An online platform to meet and practice language will eliminate or at least reduce the reluctance of language learners to use their target language more often.


### 1.2 – Problem Identification


#### 1.2.1 Symptoms of the Problem

Sri Lanka has a deep language divide. Sri Lankans like to form their identity around their mother tongue and merrily ignore other languages [4]. The civil unrest in the country could be partially attributed to this language divide that exists in the society. A regional divide compounds this problem. That is, the residents of certain regions speak only Sinhala, and other regions speak only Tamil. In a city like Colombo you could find a native speaker of both languages. However, outside of cities, most regions are monolingual. So even if you want to learn a second language, you simply cannot find a native speaker around. This is where the proposed project aims to make an impact. Even if you live in a monolingual region in Sri Lanka, you can find a language partner from the comfort of your home using the language exchange platform - named LangExchange LK.

People in South Asia find it difficult to practice a foreign language in their home or educational environments due to cultural factors. This plays a significant role in the failure to acquire second language for most Sri Lankans [6]. Historically, two languages were spoken in Sri Lanka. They were Tamil and Sinhala. The colonial rule of British during 1815 to 1948 brought English into the then Ceylon. English has stayed on as the preferred language of tertiary education and language of business in the majority of the registered companies in Sri Lanka. There is also a small but rising number of native English speakers in Sri Lanka [7]. Native English speakers are mainly found in urban areas such as Colombo or Kandy in Sri Lanka. Due to these various factors, English has also developed into a language used widely by Sri Lankans. Hence, in today’s context, fluency in all these three languages is essential to lead a fulfilling life in Sri Lanka.


#### 1.2.2 Justification of the project

A survey on language learning was carried out in order to understand the market of this project [Appendix 1?]. 86 people of different districts, and different native languages responded to the  survey [Appendix 2?]. 98.8% of the responders said that they would like to learn a second language.



<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")


When asked for the preferred mode of learning a language, language exchange platform was the second most popular answer just behind watching audiovisual media on the target language. 57% of the people mentioned that they will be willing to use an online language platform such as the one this project aims to build. The third most popular way was learning with language books. This shows that there is a market need for such a project in the country.



<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")


In addition, 66.3% of the respondents said they are willing to pay a monthly subscription to use such a language exchange platform. 27.9% of the responders were willing to pay more than LKR 500 per month. This demonstrates the financial feasibility of this project and its ability to attract paid users. This further shows the commitment of the potential users towards such a web application and its utility. Since this project is a platform rather than a resource website for language learning, the maintenance cost is down to only hosting, domain name, and support expenditures. The initial development cost will be a one time cost and after the initial development the focus can be shifted to marketing and promotions. The content on this website will be generated by the users and the admins will assume a role of mere moderators.



<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image3.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")


The following pie chart shows the amount of time per week the respondents are willing to commit to learning a language. 83.7% of the respondents are ready to spend more than one hour per week on language learning activities. This could translate to at least one hour of usage of our platform if designed properly. Even an hour per week of usage is good enough to build a web application with a successful business [8]. It is also noteworthy that slightly more than 50% of the respondents have said they are ready to spend between 1-2 hours per week.



<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image4.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert5">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")


Furthermore, 40.7% of the respondents have said they are willing to receive targeted advertisements based on their profile and behaviour.



<p id="gdcalert5" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image5.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert6">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image5.png "image_tooltip")


This paves the way for more commercialization of this project by collaborating with language learning resource providers like language schools, bookshops and promoting their product to suitable users on the platform. The conversion rate will be high in this mode of advertising because the users are generally self-motivated individuals who are able and willing to acquire resources related to language learning. Compared to promoting on a general social media platform like Facebook, this platform will be more effective for the promotion partners.


### 1.4 – Objectives of the Project

The objective of this project is to develop an online platform where language learners in Sri Lanka can meet other language learners. We will name the platform LangExchangeLK. At LangExchange LK one can learn Tamil, Sinhala, and English. For example, if you are a native Sinhala speaker, and you want to learn Tamil, you can register with the relevant information at [www.langexchange.lk](http://www.langexchange.lk). You will be able to explore native Tamil speakers who wish to learn Sinhala. You can follow their profile to get updates about their posts. You can message them directly and start a conversation. You can message in English, Tamil, or Sinhala. If the receiver prefers, he or she will respond and you both can begin language exchange. You can teach him / her Sinhala, while learning Tamil with their help. You also have another explore option where you can see the posts of all native Tamil speakers who wish to learn Sinhala in an “Explore” page whether you follow them or not. In this page, one can share language learning resources and thoughts that will help the community.

Through this platform, we hope to enable people living in all corners of the country to be able to exchange language. The limitations and problems faced by a linguistic student discussed in section 1.2.1 will be minimized once this project materialises. Even if you live in a remote monolingual region in Sri Lanka, you will be able to meet a native speaker. This will enable the students to have more practice in their target language. In addition, an online platform provides enough masquerade for even shy persons to start practicing. Since the users are connected with equally aspiring learners, there will be no room for judgement or discouragement. In case if a user does not like his or her language partner, he or she can look for another partner in no time.

Through the explore page, a user will be able to share his or her thoughts on the language they are learning, resources and links, and even write an essay in their target language and ask others to correct it. Another advantage of having this explore page is to allow a user to find someone immediately when he is having some free time. If his or her language partner is not available at some time, users can immediately post on the explore page requesting a conversation with whoever available at that point in time.

Another important objective of this project is to adopt this platform to suit the local context. The expectations of Sri Lankans with regard to such a platform is different from European language exchange platforms. There are unique privacy concerns that need to be addressed. In order to understand the local context and general market for this product a survey was done. The results of this survey will be discussed in chapter four.


### 1.5 – Significance of the Project

This project aspires to address one of the fundamental issues faced by the country which is lack of bilingualism and understanding of languages other than one’s mother tongue. Bilingualism is imperative for a multi-ethnic, multi-ethnic society to thrive. An online language exchange platform will greatly help the cause of increasing bilingualism in our country. This website will be free for everyone to register. Hence, everyone with internet access will be able to profit from this project.

Sinhala-Tamil bilingualism will promote communal harmony by augmenting the understanding between them. When one knows another language, he or she will start understanding their culture and start developing an empathy for other cultures. Meanwhile, Sinhala-English, or Tamil-English will provide more job opportunities and international exposure to the learners. It is established that lack of English knowledge triggered partially by linguistic nationalistic movements have harmed the economy and prosperity [2].

By contrast, Singapore which embraced English with open arms was able to attract international business opportunities at a very high rate [3]. When a multinational company looks for a country to open their next office, they will most certainly look at the English proficiency among the population. This is because almost all international business is done in English and the language of operation for most of the international companies is English.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no parallel project or product targeting Sri Lankan users available on the market. Even though there are international platforms where Sri Lankan users are able to register, they usually lack support for local languages such as Tamil or Sinhala. So far, the preferred mode of learning a language in Sri Lanka has been tuition classes. Even after years of following classes, some people fail to acquire basic knowledge of the language. However, this exchange platform will, by its nature, make the users converse in their target language since day one.


### 1.6 – Limitations of the Project

TODO: Add feature request from the survey

The limitations of this project are threefold. Firstly, this is an online platform. So the assumption is a language learner will have access to a computer or a mobile phone with an internet connection. However, the internet penetration rate in Sri Lanka is around 34% [1]. So the rest 66% of the population will not be able to use this platform. On the other hand, the younger population will have more access to the internet than the older generation. The primary target of this platform is adolescents and young adults. So among this slice of population, the internet penetration will be more than 34%.

Secondly, not all features of a full-fledged production-ready platform will be implemented at the end of this project. Some of the excluded features are, audio and video calling, adding support for a special type of user - teacher, and support for uploading video content. This will have an impact on the utilizability of this platform. However, further development can be done on this project extending it and adding the missing features. The architecture of this project will allow such additions in the future.

In addition, the success of this project depends on the adoption among the users. A new user will be interested in joining and using this platform only if at least a few dozen potential language partners are already available on the site. This initial momentum can be provided by paying initial users to be active for a few months, or other targeted promotions like in person promotion at language schools all over the country. Once this initial number of people start using the platform on a regular basis, then it will become self-sustaining and new users will join for the high number of potential matches awaiting him or her.

Another limitation is the lack of access to internet and internet connected devices among students. Traditionally, Sri Lankan students are deliberately denied access to the internet at their schools and homes to make them focus more on learning based on books. Since this is a digital platform, it could be difficult to reach students who are a potentially significant user group. However, with the coronavirus pandemic, the shift towards online education has begun in Sri Lanka, and parents, teachers, and administrators have started to understand the significance of internet access. This shift will indirectly help this project by making a once unreachable user segment reachable through the internet.


### 1.7 – Chapter Outline


## CHAPTER TWO – REVIEW OF EXISTING SOLUTIONS (1790)

To the best of our knowledge, there is no online language exchange platform specifically for Sri Lankans. However, there are international language exchange platforms where Sri Lankans can get registered and find a language partner. The following are some of the websites where language learners from Sri Lanka can find a language partner. look for papers that talk about language exchange


### 2.1 Language Exchange Websites


#### 2.1.1 My Language Exchange - https://www.mylanguageexchange.com/

My Language Exchange is a Canadian language exchange website which was started in 2000 in Ontario. This website has a dedicated page for Sri Lanka [9] where you can meet fellow Sri Lankan language learners.



<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image6.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert7">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image6.png "image_tooltip")


On this page you can search for language exchange partners using filters such as native language, practicing language, city, age, gender, and the prefered method of contact. This website has good search engine optimization and appears as the first result for the search phrase “language exchange sri lanka”. This website is active and hundreds of registered Sri Lankan language learners are using this website.

However, the website looks very outdated and lacks the modern web development concepts such as responsiveness, optimization for mobile screens, etc. This platform also lacks instant messaging features. Users meet on this platform and then move onto other communication platforms such as Skype, WhatsApp, or E-mail. So the users will generally spend some initial time on this website to search and find a suitable language partner and then stop or reduce visiting this website. This model is not sustainable for a successful business.

This platform has a language partner explore page which can be found at [10]. There are around 10400 users to browse from. It is also notable that this website supports other languages such as European ones. Hence, there are Sri Lankan users who are looking to learn languages such as French, German, Korean, Chinese, Russian, Italian, Japanese etc. can also be found on this page.

There are two types of membership options. One is “Regular Member” and the other is “Gold Member”. Regular membership is free whereas gold membership costs a monthly recurring subscription fee. For one month it costs 6 USD. However, you can save on the subscription by paying 12 USD for 3 months or 24 USD for 12 month subscriptions. Gold members can initiate contact with unlimited number of members and they can also post, edit messages on their bulletin board.


#### 2.1.2 Language.Exchange - https://language.exchange/

Language Exchange is a website started in 2015 in France. It also has a dedicated page for Sri Lanka which can be accessed at [11]. The website can be translated into 13 languages. However, Tamil or Sinhala is not one of them so Sri Lankan users are left with using the website in English.



<p id="gdcalert7" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image7.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert8">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image7.png "image_tooltip")


There is no filter available to narrow down the search of language partners like city, sex, etc. filters. So it is difficult to find a user that we desire through the interface. Most users will end up contacting a user they see on the first few pages. This is not an ideal situation since language partners become close over time and they need to be able to get along well. In addition, if we can meet language partners from the same city, we can even arrange a face to face meeting after a while.

This solution also suffers from outdated web application technologies. The web page is static, and is not responsive for the screen size or mobile devices. Around 52% of web traffic worldwide is generated from mobile devices (excluding tablets) [12]. So it is imperative to adopt new technologies to stay relevant in this fast changing internet environment.

This website is completely free to get registered and to use. There are no premium features and all the features are available to all users. As a result, even users from developing countries can take full advantage of this platform. However, on the other hand, it is difficult to find revenues or funding to hire engineers to maintain and update this web application since this has no business model.

There are around 250 registered users from Sri Lanka on this website. The less popularity of this application can be attributed to the lack of search engine optimization. This application has support for sending messages within the website. However, this is more like an e-mail rather than an instant messaging since it does not show online information of the user, nor the messages are instantaneous. It is notable that sent messages can be corrected with highlighting by the receiver.


#### 2.1.3 Open Language Exchange - https://en.openlanguageexchange.com/

Open Language Exchange is a website founded in 2011 in Spain. This platform also has a dedicated page for Sri Lankan users. You can access the page at [14]. This website cannot be accessed in Sinhala or Tamil however, English version of the website is available.



<p id="gdcalert8" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image8.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert9">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image8.png "image_tooltip")


This website has responsive and mobile screen support. The website is attractive and language partners are termed as “Tandem” on this platform. Multiple types of desired communication medium such as Skype, Google Talk, WhatsApp, Facetime etc can be listed for contact with potential language partners. However, a direct messaging feature within the website is not available.

In addition, this website does not support Sinhala as a language for exchange but Tamil is available. There are also only around 20 registered users from Sri Lanka. However, the location settings on this website is inaccurate, and hence some users outside Sri Lanka are classified as Sri Lankan users. This website also provides a city based filtering of users which can be used to prevent reaching misclassified users. For example, if you want to find a language partner from Colombo, you can visit the Colombo page within Sri Lanka to explore users from Colombo.

This website is completely free to use by all users. There are no premium or locked features so all users get to enjoy the full range of services available on the site. However, due to lack of careful development, there are translation errors all over the website. For example, on the interface for contacting users, Spanish titles get rendered. These developmental overlooks can be attributed to the fact that this website is free and hence they don’t spend much on maintenance. There are also a very small number of Sri Lankan users so the country specific pages might have been deprioritized during development.

This platform provides three special filters such as “Online”, “Face-to-face”, and “Penpal” which are listed as tabs on the explore page. You can visit these tabs to explore users who only prefer online communication or only prefer face to face communication. So this platform can be used to find a real life language partner whom you can meet and talk.


#### 2.1.4 HelloTalk - https://www.hellotalk.com/?lang=en

This is a predominantly mobile application based language exchange platform. HelloTalk supports 150+ languages for exchange and has over 20 million users worldwide according to the claims of developers. HelloTalk is available as Android and iOS applications for download on respective application stores. The Android version of this application has been downloaded over 10 million times. This project was started in 2012 by Zackery Ngai [15]. HelloTalk now has offices in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China.



<p id="gdcalert9" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image9.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert10">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image9.png "image_tooltip")


HelloTalk is one of the most feature rich language exchange applications. They have a user search system with filters for country, city, languages spoken, etc. Voice-to-text feature is available to convert a voice message from your partner to text in case you don’t understand what is being said. Text-to-speech is also available to learn pronunciation of new words. Transliteration feature is available to convert the pronunciation of one word to a written form in your native language. Translation service is available within the chat message window to help one understand the received messages. You can also make free video and audio calls within the application itself which removes the need for moving to another platform such as Skype or WhatsApp entirely. This also helps protect a user’s privacy as there is no need to exchange mobile numbers or emails. You can keep a personal dictionary called “Favorites” where you can store words, sentences, audio files, pictures etc for future reference. Automated grammar correction as well as correction of messages by language partners is supported in this platform.

Tamil and Sinhala languages are also available on this platform for exchange, however, there is limited support for translation and text to speech features when it comes to Sinhala. HelloTalk has no concept of followers or friends. All users stay in equal state for all other potential language partners. However, the users with whom you have initiated a conversation are shown on the messages tab.

HelloTalk has a premium membership which costs LKR 1290 per month or LKR 6700 per year or LKR 19750 for lifetime membership. Premium membership is called HelloTalk VIP and premium members can learn and teach upto three languages at one time. Free users can only learn one language and teach one language.


### 2.2 Advantages of our solution

It should be noted that most of the Sri Lankan users on the aforementioned platform are looking to learn English. In return, Sri Lankan users offer Sinhala or Tamil. However, there are not many native English speakers in the world who are looking to learn Tamil or Sinhala. Spanish, French and Mandarin are among the most sought after second languages by native English speakers [13]. So finding a matching language partner is difficult on these international websites. On the other hand, native English speakers in Sri Lanka are more likely and willing to learn Sinhala and Tamil as their second language. This increases the chances of finding a language partner.

It is clear from these existing platforms that there is a huge need for language exchange among Sri Lankan users. However, so far this need has not been met properly due to the lack of a locally focused solution. There are several privacy requirements unique to Sri Lanka as stated in the responses to the survey like,

_“It would be better if not too much personal information is required while signing up for the platform and also need a facility where we can stop contacting a person who minuses the platform without any worries”_

_“Should be able to hide personal information from others.”_

_“To learn without misusable personal details (example: phone number, photo)”_

The rest of the responses can be found in the answers to the question “What privacy settings do you expect on the platform and what steps do you expect administrators to take to prevent misuse and exploitation?” in appendix 2.


## CHAPTER THREE – DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY (2500)

LangExchange LK web application was built using the MERN stack. That is MongoDB as the database, Express as the server, React JS for the front end Javascript library and Node as the server side framework. This is a very popular technology stack for developing web applications these days [16].

MongoDB was chosen for its simplicity and scalability. It is a database of documents, which are JSON-like (JavaScript Object Notation) data with querying support. It can run on moderately powerful computers which makes it very developer friendly. We don’t need to set up a database server, we can just download and install MongoDB on the developer machine and get going. However, one disadvantage of MongoDB is the absence of database joins. For the purpose of our web application, it was deemed that joins are not essential, and can be handled within MongoDB with minimal data redundancy.

Express has become the de facto web application framework for Node.js. It has a smooth integration with Node and saves a lot of time for developers by eliminating the need of writing servers. In addition, a development server can easily start up on commodity hardware while still being optimized for actual production environments in a server.

React JS was originally developed by Facebook for their web application and subsequently open sourced. It is essentially a frontend library and not a frontend framework like Angular. React uses a virtual DOM which renders only the changed components within a page. This gives the website the feeling of a native application. React enables the development of single page web applications. Since it is necessary to give native app-like feel in our language exchange platform React was chosen as the frontend library. In addition, React uses JSX files which allow the co-existence of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS scripts on the same file. This improves the readability of the code since all code related to a component will be found in a single file.

Node.js is a Javascript runtime environment built using Google Chrome JavaScript engine version 8. This runtime is quick in execution and is very scalable. It is aggressively maintained by Google and regularly updated with new features.

All components of MERN stack are open source. So there is no need to obtain a license if we ever decide to commercialize our application. In addition, React JS and Node.js allow the same code to be executed concurrently in the client side as well as server side. Hence the application will be in total sync and function smoothly.


### 3.1 Software Requirements Specification


#### 3.1.1 Introduction

This SRS document presents the plan for the development of the project “LangExchangeLK”, a system developed by Niruhan Viswarupan. The audience of this document will be the developers working on the project currently and who will maintain this project in the future. This document contains information on system functionality, the scope, the release and availability estimates, the potential risks and their mitigations, process of development and related statistics.


#### 3.1.2 Overview

Sri Lanka is a multilingual country where three languages, Sinhala, Tamil, and English are predominantly spoken. Traditional way of learning language is going to language classes is still the most prevalent way of language acquisition. This project aims to develop a language exchange platform where Sri Lankans can find language partners and learn together. This platform will provide more chances to actually use the language for the learners.


#### 3.1.3 Customers

All Sri Lankans who want to learn a second language. They should have access to the internet and basic IT knowledge.


#### 3.1.4 Functionality



*   Users should be able to sign up and create a learning profile
*   User should be able to find matching language partners
*   User should be able to send and receive message to a language partner
*   User should be able to post text, and photo posts
*   Posts by others learning the same language should be discoverable
*   Messages in other languages should be translated and shown alongside in the chat window
*   System should suggest best matching language partners based on compatibility
*   User should get notification about new followers
*   User should be able to edit his personal information
*   User should be able to upload profile picture and cover picture
*   User should be able to see posts by the partners he or she follows
*   User should be able to view an introduction text, pictures, posts, language information, age, sex, and city of other users by visiting their profile
*   User should be able to filter potential partner discovery with city, sex, and age range


#### 3.1.5 Development Responsibility

I, Niruhan Viswarupan, will be solely responsible for the development of the application and deployment until the date of the end of the academic requirements for the MSc IT program. Thereafter, the project will be made open source on GitHub where the open source community can contribute to the project.


#### 3.1.6 Deliverables

The deliverables through this project are as follows,



*   Survey statistics on language learning in Sri Lanka
*   Design of a language exchange platform
*   Dissertation on LangExchange LK
*   Open source code in GitHub
*   Publicly accessible platform on [www.langexchange.lk](www.langexchange.lk)


#### 3.1.7 Risk Management

The identified risks in the project are as follows,



*   Compreting international platforms dominating the user share
*   Delay in delivering the project
*   Lack of knowledge on frontend development of the developer
*   Risk of plateauing due to lack of initial users to make the platform interesting for new users

The above risk can be mitigated using the following strategies,



*   Focus on the local market needs and provide a tailor-made solution which will attract the users.
*   Provide privacy features requested by Sri Lankan users in the survey
*   Allocate time every day to work on the project after office hours
*   Track the project progress through GitHub project page by opening issues under columns such as “Todo”, “Immediate action items”, “In Progress”, “Completed”, and “On Hold”
*   Learn React JS and frontend javascript technologies in Youtube tutorials
*   Leverage the experience in Java and Python to quickly learn and understand Javascript
*   Use developer support communities such as StackOverflow, and other forums to clear roadblocks
*   After launching the product do targeted promotion in educational institutes to capture the initial user base
*   Consider providing monetary reward to first 100 - 1000 users depending on the available funding


#### 3.1.8 Release Plans


#### 3.1.9 Technical Processes




### 3.2 Software Development Life Cycle

Spiral SDLC was chosen for the development of LangExchangeLK. This is because, it was better to start implementation with a basic set of requirements and produce an application and then iteratively improve the product in subsequent cycles of development after feedback from the supervisor. However, the first cycle covered the majority of the identified requirements and majority of the implemented features. So, the development can also be considered as a mix of waterfall and spiral SDLC.

#### 3.2.1 First Cycle

This was the major cycle of the development. At the start of this cycle the survey that we discussed in chapter one was performed and the following feature requirements were identified.



<p id="gdcalert11" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image11.png).

![alt_text](images/image11.png "image_tooltip")


The following features were finalized for implementation during this cycle.



*   Login / Signup, Profile, Home, Learners, Messages page
*   Search bar
*   Instant messaging
*   Write posts and comments, like a post
*   Follow users

In the second stage of this cycle, the architecture of the system as a whole was designed. The web application developed contains two independent runtimes, backend and frontend, which communicate through a GraphQL API.

![alt_text](images/image12.png "image_tooltip")


GraphQL was chosen instead of a simpler REST API because it allows us to request for only the fields that we require from the frontend. This is in contrast to retrieving the entire JSON payload by calling a REST endpoint and then parsing the JSON to find the required value. Hence, GraphQL allows us to save bandwidth in frontend - backend communication by receiving only required data and as a consequence, improves the speed of frontend application. GraphQL is not actually a software program [17]. It is rather a data query and manipulation language for API’s. It is a set of definitions and rules. It was developed by Facebook in 2012 and then subsequently released for open source usage in 2015 [18]. There exist many implementations of this specification. I have chosen Apollo GraphQL platform [19] which provides both a GraphQL server to be used in the backend and a GraphQL client to be used in the frontend.


##### Architecture of the Backend System

The backend is developed using Node.js, a Javascript runtime. Backend handles requests from the frontend and responds with appropriate data. Backend also handles data persistence and reading from MongoDB. Let’s begin the analysis of the backend with a review of data modelling. The data models are defined using Mongoose JS library schemas.


###### Data Models

User model holds data related to each user. This data contains both user’s personal data and platform specific data such as the user’s followers etc.

The fields which have “true” for the “Required” column should be passed when a User is created. The other fields are optional, and can be added later after adding the user. Email and username fields have additional conditions to be unique, lowercase and without any whitespace (trim). The isOnline field is set to false by default, It will be set to true when the user is online i.e actively browsing the LangExchange application. The fields that have a reference are used to link entries in other documents to a particular user. For example, take the field “post”. It is an array of ObjectIds of post data. The posts made by a user will be linked to the account using this reference array. Setting the timestamps as true will automatically keep track of created and last updated time of each document within the collection.

None of the fields in the post schema is mandatory. However, usually the title and the author fields are necessary. Title holds the text of the post and author holds the ObjectId of the user who wrote the post. It is important to note that even if the type of author is Schema.Types.ObjectId, it is not an array. Only one ObjectId exists in the field’s value. We cannot have multiple authors for a single post.

The fields authorNativeLanguage, and authorTargetLanguage and respectively the nativeLanguage and targetLanguage of the author. This information can be retrieved from the user document using the user ObjectId. However, as we noted in the introduction of chapter three, such data duplication is necessary in light of the absence of table joins in MongoDB. 

We have an explore page where we show the posts of users who have compatible languages. To retrieve this list of posts, we need the language information of the author. Even though it is possible to first retrieve the post and then using the user ObjectId retrieve the relevant language information from the user document. This process involves two database access which is slow as the database is persisted in harddisk. Hard disk space is traded off to gain time during retrieval.

The notification document holds a single notification a user will see in the notifications page. For example, this can be a notification of a new follower. Here two Users are linked, one is the “author”, by whom this notification was generated, and “user”, who will receive this notification. This document will also have a reference to the topic to which it corresponds, a post, like, follow, or comment. There is a boolean flag “seen” which is set to true once the user sees the particular notification.

Comment document holds reference to the author of the comment, post on which the comment was written and the actual comment string. The “comment” field is mandatory.

The following piece of code shows how a schema can be defined in Node.js using Mongoose library. This is the implementation of the Post model and the other models are similar.


```
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

/**
 * Post schema that has references to User, Like and Comment schemas
 */
const postSchema = Schema(
    {
        title: String,
        image: String,
        imagePublicId: String,
        author: {
            type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
            ref: 'User',
        },
        authorNativeLanguage: String,
        authorTargetLanguage: String,
        likes: [
            {
                type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
                ref: 'Like',
            },
        ],
        comments: [
            {
                type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
                ref: 'Comment',
            },
        ],
    },
    {
        timestamps: true,
    }
);
export default mongoose.model('Post', postSchema);
```



###### GraphQL API

Three types of interactions between the frontend and the backend are possible through the GraphQL API. They are queries, mutations, and subscriptions. Queries are used for data retrieval from the MongoDB database through the backend. Mutations are used to write data to MongoDB. Subscriptions are used to add a listener to events that can occur during the run time. For example, when we visit the page of a potential partner we need to see whether he is online or not. We can do this by adding a listener to isUserOnline event with the ID of the potential partner. If the potential partner is online true will be returned and if he or she is offline false will be returned.

Because of the dynamic nature of the response to GraphQL queries, there is a need to write resolver functions manually for each query and mutation. The following piece of code shows the resolver function for getMessages query.


```
/**
* Gets user's specific conversation
*
* @param {string} authUserId
* @param {string} userId
*/
    getMessages: async (root, {authUserId, userId}, {Message}) => {
        const specificMessage = await Message.find()
            .and([
                {$or: [{sender: authUserId}, {receiver: authUserId}]},
                {$or: [{sender: userId}, {receiver: userId}]},
            ])
            .populate('sender')
            .populate('receiver')
            .sort({updatedAt: 'asc'});

        return specificMessage;
    }
```


The following is the list of GraphQL queries available in our backend system. Note that the data types marked with a “!” are mandatory input parameters and others are optional. Refer [Appendix 3] for GraphQl schema which describes schema such as SuccessMessage, UserPayload, etc.

  <tr>

The above image shows the sitemap of langexchange.lk. 


#### 3.1.2 Second Cycle

The second cycle was focused on optimizing the features to suite the needs of a language learner well. The following features were implemented in this cycle



*   Edit info page
*   Show only users with matching language preferences in Learners page
*   Explore page
*   Filter learners using city, age, sex

The following new queries and mutations were added to GraphQL API.

![alt_text](images/image14.png "image_tooltip")



#### 3.1.3 Third Cycle

Third cycle of development was performed to add message translation feature. Google Translate API was chosen for this feature since it is the most accurate [20] and it was the only one that had support for Sinhala language translation. In order to use Google Translate API, we first need to create a Google Cloud user account and create a project. After providing billing details we need to enable Translate API for the aforementioned project and then generate an GOOGLE_API_KEY that we use authenticate our REST API calls.

You can send your request in the following format,

https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?key=GOOGLE_API_KEY&q=cheese&target=si

q - the text that needs to be translated

target - the language to which the text should be translated

We will get a response as follows,

{

  "data": {

    "translations": [

      {

        "translatedText": "චීස්",

        "detectedSourceLanguage": "en"

      }

    ]

  }

}

This calls were set up from the frontend without going through the backend. A translate button was added to every message box which can be clicked to translate the message to the user’s native language.


#### 3.1.4 Fourth Cycle

This cycle was performed to fine tune the platform and prepare it for deployment in Amazon Web Services and serve it at www.langexchange.lk. During this cycle, a user recommendation feature based on a custom algorithm was also implemented.


### 3.2 Version Controlling

GitHub was used for version controlling the source code. The source repository can be found at [21]. 



<p id="gdcalert15" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image15.png).

<p id="gdcalert16" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image16.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert17">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image16.png "image_tooltip")


(Subset of the commit history)

As of 14th October 2020 234 commits have been made to this repository.



<p id="gdcalert17" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image17.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert18">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image18.png "image_tooltip")


Github project page was used for project management. Features chosen for development were added as issues in the project which shows up in the “To Do” column in the following image.



<p id="gdcalert19" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image19.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert20">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image19.png "image_tooltip")


The “In Progress” column has the features that are currently under development. “Done” column has the completed features. There are also two additional columns “Immediate Action Items” for the features that will be implemented next, and “On Hold” for the features that are rejected.


### 3.3 Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment

Continuous integration practice advocates developers to merge works to the main source code repository as much as several times per day. Every merge / integration is verified by an automated build and testing mechanisms [22]. As you can see in the image below a CI build badge is shows in the readme to indicate whether the build is passing, failing, or unstable.



<p id="gdcalert20" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image20.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert21">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image20.png "image_tooltip")


This badge is produced by a Node CI builder set up using Github Actions. You can see the build history below.



<p id="gdcalert21" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image21.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert22">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image21.png "image_tooltip")


For each commit to the master branch Node CI build runs and produces a report as follows.



<p id="gdcalert22" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image22.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert23">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image22.png "image_tooltip")


You can observe that there are 3 builds for each commit. This is to build in three Node.js versions 10, 12, and 14 to make sure the source code build is passing in all versions.

Continuous deployment is a production strategy where the new features and changes added to the source code is immediately released to production environment after continuous integration tests are done [23]. This makes sure that the users of the software are always on the bleeding edge of technology and are able to enjoy newest features as soon as they are created.

Two repository branches were created to maintain a separation between the master and the production environments as shown below.



<p id="gdcalert23" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image23.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert24">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image23.png "image_tooltip")


This “production” branch is linked to the continuous deployment pipeline of langexchange.lk. Amazon Code Pipeline tool was used for this purpose. The following image shows the Code Pipeline dashboard.



<p id="gdcalert24" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image24.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert25">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image24.png "image_tooltip")


The production branch is configured as the source. Every commit into the production branch will trigger this pipeline and it will be pushed into the production instance in the “Deploy” stage. The hosting is explained in the following section.


### 3.4 Hosting

Amazon Web Services was chosen as the web hosting platform for www.langexchange.lk. The main reasons for this choice was because of the flexible scalability of AWS, high availability, and a pay-as-you-go payment model which suits a startup better [24]. AWS Elastic Beanstalk orchestration service was used for hosting the application. Elastic Beanstalk is a managed hosting where Node.js environment is auto-configured and deployment ready. This is as opposed to renting an EC2 instance and installing Node.js, ReactJS and all the application dependencies manually and deploying the service. Using Elastic Beanstalk removes all these extra devops work. The following image shows the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard used for configuration. This instance is linked to the Code Pipeline which pushes changes for deployment.

## CHAPTER FOUR – PROJECT PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS (3580)


### 4.1 User Experience

The base URL initially lands in the landing page. You can sign up as a new user or login using your credentials. This page looks as follows.



<p id="gdcalert25" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image25.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert26">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image25.png "image_tooltip")


After logging in or signing up, you will be shown a home page. This home page is also served in the base URL.



<p id="gdcalert26" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image26.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert27">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image26.png "image_tooltip")


From the home page you can navigate to all other pages. In all pages, a header which contains a search bar, drop down menus for messages, notifications, and profile is shown on the top. The following is the profile page.



<p id="gdcalert27" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image27.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert28">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image27.png "image_tooltip")


The profice page shows the user’s profile picture, cover image, full name, introduction text, follower count, native and target language, location, sex, age, and posts by the user. It is important to note that there are two versions of this profile page. If you visit your own profile page there will be a textbox to write a post and a “Edit Info” button which will direct you to a “Edit Info” page. The following image shows the “Edit Info” page.



<p id="gdcalert28" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image28.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert29">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image28.png "image_tooltip")


In this page you can edit the information you entered when signing up and add additional information as well. If you decide to learn a different language you change the target language on this page and after update you will see potential partners for the new target language.



<p id="gdcalert29" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image29.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert30">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image29.png "image_tooltip")


The image above shows the “Explore” page. In this page, you can see posts from all the potential language partners irrespective of whether you follow them or not. Hence, you will be able to discover ideas and resources from people whom you haven’t connected yet. This page also can be used to find an instant partner. For example, if none of your connected partners are online at a time, you can post on this page requesting for anyone online to chat. This way, you are assured to have someone to learn with always.



<p id="gdcalert30" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image30.png).

![alt_text](images/image30.png "image_tooltip")


This is the “Learners” page. Here you will see tiles containing potential language partners whom you have not followed. Each tile will show the user’s profile picture, full name, language infor, and a follow button. Here, you can connect with new language partners.



<p id="gdcalert31" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image31.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert32">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image31.png "image_tooltip")


This is the notifications page where you can see your notifications. The following image shows the instant messaging page.



<p id="gdcalert32" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image32.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert33">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image32.png "image_tooltip")


In the “Messages” page you will see a list of users and corresponding conversations. You can click on a conversation to view the messages. The most important feature of this platform is found in this page. With each message there is a “Translate” button. If you click the translate button, the contents of that particular message will be translated and shown in your native language. Even if your partner has messaged you in multiple languages the platform will detect the language and always translate to your native language. Our translation supports over 100 languages. The following image shows how the translated message looks.

### 4.2 Responsiveness

The frontend of this application was designed and developed keeping mobile responsiveness in mind. Responsive web design is a philosophy that underlines the need for using flexible layout designs that re-orient themselves for better viewing experience in several different screen sizes and aspect ratios [25]. Users of today browse websites from devices such as laptop, tablet computer, mobile phones, etc. Traditional websites which only render well in laptop screens lose a lot of visitors due to their static nature which is difficult to use in mobile screens.

The above graph shows the network traffic from mobile and desktop devices during the period 2009 to 2016. Now, the mobile internet traffic is more than that of desktop. So, we risk losing the majority of users if we fail to make our web page responsive.

Another solution to handle mobile traffic is to implement native applications for each mobile platform. That is developing a separate Android application and an iOS application. However, this solution is time consuming, expensive, and requires a team of engineers working on different platforms. A native application will always be faster and more responsive than a responsive web application. However, for startups and debutant projects, this approach is discouraged since the sheer load of effort required will sink the project into failure without adequate resources.

LangExchange LK application used FlexBoxes to make the website responsive. The following are some screenshots of how the website looks when viewed through a mobile browser. 

The image to the left shows the login screen. Google Chrome’s developer tool was used to simulate the screen dimensions of a Google Pixel 2 XL mobile phone. Note that the extra text and introduction have been hidden in this view.

This image shows the home page. Note that the left navigation bar is minimized and the user suggestion column to the right is removed in this view.

This image shows the profile page. Note that the width of the information box has shrunk and as a result some user information such as city, age, and sex have moved to the next row.

This image shows how the minimized side navigation bar looks like after being expanded by clicking on the three horizontal lines icon on the top left.

This image shows the learners page. Notice that from a table view tiles have changed to a list view where you see only one tile per row.

This image shows the messages page. Notice how the conversation list column has shrunk to make more space for the messages view.

### 4.3 Presence on the Internet

This application is presented as a website on the internet. The language exchange platform is publicly accessible on the URL www.langexchange.lk. This URL was purchased on 4th September 2020 through the domain broker and hosting provider service website www.register.lk, a subsidiary of Solution Infinity (Pvt) Ltd. You can see their management dashboard in the image below.



<p id="gdcalert35" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image35.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert36">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image35.png "image_tooltip")


The cost of this domain name for a year is LKR 2700 without hosting service from the same provider. You can see the purchase invoice in the appendix 4. An additional LKR 100 transaction fee was charged and the total cost of LKR 2800 was paid to www.register.lk on 4th September 2020.

Since it was decided to host this website in AWS, only domain was purchased without the subsidized hosting.If we are continuing this language exchange platform project, we need to make the next annual payment on 3rd September 2021 to prevent this URL being bought by anyone else.

Furthermore, search engine optimization was implemented in the index.js page of this application. The React-helmet library was used for this purpose. It is a simple HTML parser which takes in HTML tags and passes HTML tags out. The following piece of code shows the SEO tags.


```
<Helmet>
    <meta charSet="utf-8" />
    <title>LangExchangeLK</title>
    <link rel="canonical" href="www.langexchange.lk" />
    <meta name="description" content="A language exchange platform for sri lankans who want to learn a second language with a language partner"/>
    <meta name="keywords" content="language, exchange, sri lanka, language partner, tamil, english, sinhala"/>
</Helmet>
```


The keyword tag is a very important SEO parameter since the search keywords will be matched against this parameter to show the users best matching pages. It is a comma separated list where words related to our platform are written.


## CHAPTER FIVE – CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION (1790)


### 5.1 – Summary of the Project

A language exchange platform which will help Sri Lankans to learn a second language was successfully implemented. In this language exchange platform, users can freely sign up and create a personal profile. Information on their native language and their target language are mandatory. After signing up, based on their language preferences users will see a list of potential language partners. User can use filters such as city, age, sex to find a suitable language partner. You can also follow a user so that his or her posts show up in your home page.

Instant messaging feature is available with in-built translation feature so that you can converse in two languages while understanding each other. Whatever the language the message is in, it will be automatically identified and translated in your native language and shows just below the source message. Like a traditional messenger, messages are grouped as conversations based on the receiver.

A page to explore resources related to your target language can be found in the Explore page. You can see posts from all potential language partners irrespective of whether you follow them or not. This opens the door for creative usages by the users. For example, you can post asking for any online users to have a conversation if your existing partners are offline. You can post an essay you wrote in the target language and ask others to correct it for you.

Profile page is available to show posts from only one user and information such as followers, introduction text, age, sex, city, and languages. If you visit your own page, you will have the option to write new posts and edit your personal information. A notification concept exists to alert users about new followers, messages, etc.

The web application was built as a single page application. So user’s will feel as if they are using a native application instead of browsing a web page. In addition, the application is responsive to various screen sizes. They layout organises automatically to enhance viewer experience in different screen sizes.


### 5.2 – Conclusion of the Project

As discussed in chapter one, there was a real need for a language learning platform in Sri Lanka, where you can meet native speakers of Tamil, Sinhala, and English. This platform attempts to fulfill this need. This website is hosted at www.langexchange.lk. Due to the targeted nature of this application to the needs of our country, the probability of adoption remains high. The success of this project depends highly on adoption. 

For a traditional language learning website, the success depends mostly on the quality of the language learning materials, the pricing, and the marketing of the product to the target users. If there is great content, eventually our website will have high search engine optimization and many users will naturally find a way to our website and consume information. However, this exchange platform can be compared to a social network. A social network like Facebook can only be successful and self-sustaining if many users sign up and a new user is tempted by others who have already joined the network. A parallel scenario for this platform would be when a new user who natively speaks Sinhala and wants to learn Tamil signs up. He will continue to use this platform only if there are an adequate number of native Tamil speakers who want to learn Sinhala. If there are no potential language partners available, the user retention will be difficult. Hence, it is important to acquire a lot of users within the first few weeks of launch of this service.

For the reasons discussed, it is important to make entry barriers to this platform as little as possible. To this end, the sign up page was added as a widget in the landing page itself without having a separate page for signup. In addition, it is important not to add a membership fee or any kind of payment when a user initially joins. There should always be a free and usable version of this platform. Additional features such as tutoring from a teacher etc. which will be discussed in detail in the section 5.4 can be made premium features.

Furthermore, the long term goal of this project is to contribute positively to the communal harmony of Sri Lanka. Our country has a communal conflict which is compounded by the language divide. Making more and more people bilingual is a way of ameliorating the situation we find ourselves in this country. There have been noted examples of language being used as a tool to establish peace among heterogeneous communities in the world. A notable example is Singapore. However, their approach differed in the usage of English as the preferred language for education, conduct of business, and government affairs. Even though that option is also open to us, it is difficult to expect the diverse communities which take pride in their identity formed around their language, denounce their mother tongue and take up a totally foreign language. Hence, making more and more people bilingual is the best approach in the short to medium term for the country.


### 5.3 – Suggestion for Further Development

There are few features that were considered during the survey, but ended up being cancelled due to lack of time and or resources to implement. The following chart shows the features and the percentage of responders who requested that feature.



<p id="gdcalert36" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image36.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert37">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image36.png "image_tooltip")


The most requested feature is translation of messages in the chat window. This feature is implemented as a part of this project. The second most requested feature is providing basic grammar lessons within the application. This was not implemented because to prepare lessons, we need to hire professional language tutors, and it was outside the scope of a traditional language exchange platform which we intended to build in this project. However, this is a very important and useful feature which can be added to this platform in the future. Speech-to-text and text-to-speech of messages were requested by 40.7% and 39.5% of respondents respectively. These features were left out due to the bandwidth requirements of processing audio files and the text-to-speech APIs are expensive [26].

Voice call and video call which were requested by 25% and 17% of the respondents were not implemented due to the sheer complexity of its implementation, and the network requirements in the server for such a feature. Implementing a peer-to-peer call feature where the role of server is only to initially connect the two users and then after the initial connection, the call would directly be between the two parties is one way to solve the huge bandwidth requirements for the server if all the call data are routed centrally. However, this type of architecture would require implementation of both server and client in the application side which is against complex and time consuming.

Group chat, group video call, group audio call which are requested by 33%, 23%, and 26% of the respondents were not implemented as a part of deferring group learning features which were left out of implementation. These group learning features along with support for special types of users who can organise a class consisting of paying students can be added as a part of future enhancement. This will allow language teachers to expand their audience by providing online tuition on our platform. This is an attractive business opportunity for this platform as payments can be routed through the platform from which a cut can be retained. This can be an attractive proposition to gain investor confidence. Since the rollout and adoption of this feature would mean that from day one this feature will start providing revenue to our platform. The other features that can be implemented are support for sending and receiving audio messages, photos, videos, and PDF documents. Especially sharing PDF documents can be helpful for learning.

In addition to the above features, native applications for Android and iOS platforms can be implemented in the future. This will make the mobile user experience even better.
